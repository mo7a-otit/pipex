# pipex

The pipex project is designed to provide a detailed exploration of a UNIX mechanism, by implementing it in your program. This project offers an opportunity to deepen your understanding of UNIX system calls and mechanisms.

## Project Description

The main objectives of the pipex project include:
- Implementing a program that simulates the functionality of the shell command pipeline (`|`).
- Utilizing UNIX system calls, such as `fork`, `pipe`, and `execve`, to create and manage the pipeline.
- Exploring the concept of input/output redirection and its role in command execution.
- Gaining a deeper understanding of interprocess communication and synchronization.
